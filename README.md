# Quantum Gates Simulation

A library in c++ which has most of the Quantum Gates defined and can be simulated accordingly.
It creates and run qubits through quantum gates.
Many Quantum Gates like Paunli-X,Y,Z, NOT, SqrtNOT, R, C-X,Y,Z etc are implemented.

To demonstrate the working of the gates, I have taken an example of three single state qubits namely Alice(ket(0)), Bob(ket(0)) and Info(ket(1)) and studied that by apply certain gates we can transfer the information of the qubit stored in Info to Bob using Alice qubit.
